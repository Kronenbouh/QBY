Magnetic vortices in circular disks made from Fe-V single crystal film have been studied by magnetic force microscopy. At remanent state, all the disks host a single vortex structure. The magnetic contrast differs drastically from the one usually observed in "traditional" materials and reveals the influence of the four folds anisotropy originating from the bcc structure of Fe-V lattice. Field dependence of vortex position has been studied. The vortex displacement is observed to be perpendicular to the field and depends on the field direction. Micromagnetic simulations reproduce quantitatively this behavior and explain the influence of cubic magnetic anisotropy. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4711219]
