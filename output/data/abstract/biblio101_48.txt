We report magnetic domain imaging of a terbium cobalt (TbCo) alloy thin film with a high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in one- and two-photon photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). Both photoemission processes deliver a clear magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) whose strength is strongly energy dependent. Comparing the energy dependence of the MCD signal in one- and two-photon photoemission, we conclude that the magnetic contrast is mainly an initial state effect. Our results ultimately show that MCD contrast can be obtained in PEEM in valence band photoemission from a material supporting all-optical magnetization switching. This opens the way for the investigation of the all-optical switching process with simultaneous ultrahigh temporal and spatial resolution.
