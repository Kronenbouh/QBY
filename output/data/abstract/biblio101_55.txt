We show that Fe-MgO interfaces possess strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of 1.0 +/- 0.1 erg/cm(2) in fully epitaxial MgO/V/Fe/MgO(001) and MgO/Cr/Fe/MgO(001) heterostructures. The sign and amplitude of the total anisotropy are quantified as a function of Fe thickness using magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance. There is a transition from out-of-plane to in-plane anisotropy for 6 Fe monolayers in V/Fe/MgO and only 4 monolayers in Cr/Fe/MgO. A detailed study of the Fe magnetization and effective anisotropy in both systems explains this difference and quantifies the Fe-MgO interface anisotropy. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.
