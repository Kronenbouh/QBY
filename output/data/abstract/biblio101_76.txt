Crystallographic and spin polarized transport properties of (100) textured and (100) epitaxial Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junctions are compared. Strong similarities in the transport properties show that structural coherence and magnetic quality at the 25 nm grain scale in textured junctions are sufficient to issue signatures of the spin polarized transport specific to a single crystal junction. This demonstrates that the lateral coherence of the Bloch tunneling wave function is identically limited in both systems. Our analysis leads to model the textured tunnel junction as a juxtaposition of nanometer sized single crystal junctions, placed in parallel. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.
