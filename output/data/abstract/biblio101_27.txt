The value and sign of V/Fe interface anisotropy are investigated. Epitaxial V/Fe/V/Au layers with different iron thicknesses were grown on single crystalline (001) MgO substrate by ultra high vacuum molecular beam epitaxy. Magnetometry was used to measure magnetization and out anisotropy field. From these values, we quantify the number of dead layers due to V/Fe or Fe/V interfaces, and compare it with the literature. We deduce that dead layers occur mostly at the bottom V/Fe interface. An average value for V/Fe and Fe/V interface anisotropy around 0 +/- 0.1 erg/cm(2) (mJ/m(2)) was thus deduced.
