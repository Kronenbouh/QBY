Alloying Fe electrodes with V, through reduced FeV/MgO interface mismatch in epitaxial magnetic tunnel junctions with MgO barriers, notably suppresses both nonmagnetic (parallel) and magnetic (antiparallel) state 1/f noise and enhances tunneling magnetoresistance. A comparative study of the room temperature electron transport and low frequency noise in Fe1-xVx/MgO/Fe and Fe/MgO/Fe1-xVx magnetic tunnel junctions with 0 inf x sup 0.25 reveals that V doping of the bottom electrode for x infs 0.1 reduces in nearly two orders of magnitude the normalized nonmagnetic and magnetic 1/f noise. We attribute the enhanced TMR and suppressed 1/f noise to strongly reduced misfit and dislocation density. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3430064]
