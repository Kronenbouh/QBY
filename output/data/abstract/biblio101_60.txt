The chapter provides a short and intuitive introduction to the basic concept of spin-transfer torque and the field of spin-torque driven magnetization dynamics in nanopillar systems. The influence of spin-polarized currents on magnetic nano-objects may lead to current-induced magnetization reversal as well as current-driven magnetization dynamics. The quantities that determine the critical currents for magnetization switching and the influence of the relative orientation of magnetization and current polarization are discussed. We focus on the nanopillar geometry and address the influence of magnetic anisatropy on the spin-torque driven spindynamics. Selected experimental examples are given to illustrate the interplay between magnetic anisotropy and spin-transfer torque.
