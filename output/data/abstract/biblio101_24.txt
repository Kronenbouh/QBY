Topological modulation of magnetic thin films can induce a magnetic anisotropy of magnetostatic origin. In this paper, we report on the magnetic properties of NiFe layers deposited on wavy Si substrates. Without modulation, the film posses an intrinsic anisotropy. We unambiguously show that patterning the substrate overcomes the intrinsic anisotropy and establishes a new easy axis of magnetization. By choosing the patterning appropriately, orthogonal easy axes can be established at different locations of the same sample. We demonstrate the advantage of this approach in the fabrication of bidimensional magnetic sensors. (C) 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics
