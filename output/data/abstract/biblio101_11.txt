In order to tune the exchange bias training effect, a torque approach is proposed. Torque loops are performed between two consecutive hysteresis loops by clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the sample within an angular range under an in-plane external magnetic field. For the angular range from 0 degrees to 180 degrees the coercivity H(C) and the exchange field H(E) are both reduced and the pinning direction (PD) orientation is changed, exhibiting the first type training effect. For the angular range from -20 degrees to 380 degrees, H(C) and the PD orientation are almost unchanged although H(E) is reduced, exhibiting the second type training effect.
