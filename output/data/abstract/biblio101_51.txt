Single-crystalline V/Fe(0.7 nm)/MgO(1.2nm)/Fe(20 nm) magnetic tunnel junctions are studied to quantify the influence of an electric field on the Fe/MgO interface magnetic anisotropy. The thinnest Fe soft layer has a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), whereas the thickest Fe layer acts as sensor for magnetic anisotropy changes. When electrons are added at the PMA Fe/MgO interface (negative voltage), no anisotropy changes are observed. For positive voltage, the anisotropy constant decreases with increasing bias voltage. A huge 1150 fJV(-1) m(-1) anisotropy variation with field is observed and the magnetization is found to turn from out-of-plane to in-plane of the sample with the applied voltage.
