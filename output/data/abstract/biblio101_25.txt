This paper is dedicated to the preparation of thin film with a strong perpendicular to the film plane magnetic anisotropy, behaviour of great interest for spintronics. Single-crystalline [Co/Ni] (111) superlattices have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The epitaxial growth of Co and Ni was controlled by using reflection high energy diffraction (RHEED), allowing us to get an accurate control of the thicknesses. The superlattices magnetic properties were studied using magnetometry. All of them exhibit strong perpendicular to the plane magnetic anisotropy. The maximum of magneto-crystalline anisotropy is obtained for one cobalt monolayer. A simple model which takes into account surface and volume anisotropy explains the evolution of perpendicular anisotropy in these layers.
