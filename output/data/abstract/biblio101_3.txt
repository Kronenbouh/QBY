This paper concerns physical model of interdigitated sensor in the frequency range 10(2)-10(7) Hz. A theoretical approach is proposed to optimize the use of the sensor for bioimpedance spectroscopy. CoventorWare (R) software was used to modelize in three dimensions the interdigital sensor system for measuring electrical impedance of biological medium. Complete system simulation by Finite element method (FEM) was used for sensor sensitivity optimization. The influence of geometrical parameters (number of fingers, width of the electrodes), on the impedance spectroscopy of biological medium was studied.
